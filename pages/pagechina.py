In particular for China's educational sector for example, here is testimony for how working in that sector feels like from an official briefing: 
Chinaâ€™s education sector is expansive, driven by a large student population and a growing demand for diverse educational services. It is dynamic, witnessing ongoing innovation and adaptation to address evolving educational needs and preferences. China has made notable progress in delivering high-quality education, known for its rigorous standards and competitiveness.

However, with the implementation of policies like the double reduction policy (to reduce the pressures of homework and after-school tutoring), the Chinese education sector is going through a period of adaptation.
Despite challenges, the after-school tutoring market in China is projected to grow, driven by a focus on outcome-based education. (https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-education-sector-latest-trends-and-policies/)
