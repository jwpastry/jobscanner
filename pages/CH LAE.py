While traditionally seen as more academic, liberal arts degrees are becoming increasingly valued in China’s evolving job market. Graduates can find careers in education, media, publishing, public relations, cultural institutions, and government. Training for these jobs typically involves completing a university degree in a liberal arts major, often followed by internships or further specialization.
